## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
 ----------------Proposed Solution---------------- ----------------Detailed Explanation--------------
We propose a multilingual, AI-powered smart advisory platform (mobile app + chatbot + voice support) to guide small and marginal farmers in crop selection, pest management, fertilizer use, and market decisions.

(*)Farmers receive personalized, real-time advice based on soil type, weather conditions, crop history, and market prices.

(*)The app integrates AI/ML for pest detection through image uploads and predictive insights for yield optimization.

(*)Voice interaction in local languages ensures inclusivity for low-literate farmers.

(*)Offline support via SMS/IVR ensures accessibility in rural areas with poor internet connectivity.

------------How It Addresses the Problem------------

(*)Bridges knowledge gap: Farmers get scientific, reliable, real-time advice instead of relying on guesswork or shopkeepers.

(*)Localized & inclusive: Regional language + voice ensures accessibility.

(*)Saves costs & increases yield: Right fertilizer dosage, crop rotation advice, and weather alerts reduce waste and input costs.

(*)Sustainability: Promotes balanced chemical use, eco-friendly practices, and long-term soil health.

--------------- Innovation & Uniqueness------------

(*)Krishi Scientist in every pocket: AI-driven insights available anytime, anywhere.

(*)Voice-first + Multilingual design for low-literacy farmers (rare in existing agri-apps).

(*)Integrated ecosystem: Combines soil, weather, pest, and market intelligence in a single platform.
Feedback learning loop: App improves recommendations by learning from farmer outcomes.

## Technical Approach
---------------- Technical Approach---------------
Technologies to be Used
(*)Frontend: Android (Java/Kotlin, Flutter for cross-platform)
(*)Backend: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js for APIs
(*)Databases: PostgreSQL / Firebase for farmer      profiles & crop data
AI/ML:
(*)TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest & disease image recognition
(*)Predictive analytics for crop yield and weather-based suggestions
APIs:
IMD (weather), eNAM/Agmarknet (market prices)
Hardware (optional future expansion): IoT-based soil sensors
Methodology & Process for Implementation
Step 1: Farmer registers → chooses language → sets crop preferences.
Step 2: App collects soil, crop, and location data.
Step 3: AI processes inputs → generates advisory.
Step 4: Real-time alerts (weather, pest risk, market prices).
Step 5: Farmers give feedback → app refines suggestions.

## Feasibility and Viability
-----------------Feasibility & Viability------------
Feasibility Analysis
High scalability: Works across states with language modules.
Low cost to farmers: Free/ad-supported version ensures inclusivity.
Existing resources: Uses IMD, Agmarknet, and KVK datasets.
------------- Potential Challenges & Risks-----------
Low digital literacy → farmers may struggle with apps.
Poor internet in rural areas.
Accuracy of AI models in pest detection (depends on dataset quality).
Strategies to Overcome Challenges
Voice-based + IVR support for non-smartphone users.
Offline mode with SMS sync.
Continuous training of AI models using local crop/pest datasets.
Partnerships with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), NGOs, and Govt. for awareness and training.

## Impact and Benefits
------------------ Impacts & Benefits----------------
Potential Impact on Target Audience
Empowers 86% small & marginal farmers in India with scientific decision-making.
Makes agriculture less risky, more profitable, and sustainable.
Benefits
Social: Farmers become self-reliant, reduce dependence on middlemen.
Economic: Increase in yield (20–30%), reduced input costs, better market prices.
Environmental: Prevents overuse of fertilizers/pesticides, improves soil health, promotes eco-friendly farming.
